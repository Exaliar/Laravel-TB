                    1914 translation by H. Rackham

                    "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was
                    born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the
                    great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or
                    avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue
                    pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who
                    loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally
                    circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial
                    example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage
                    from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no
                    annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
